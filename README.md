# Classification of handwritten letters using an RBM
Classificaton of handwritten letters using a binary restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). 

Written as a part of my Batchelor thesis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb.

The repository includes a complete implementation of a binary RBM and the Contrastive Divergence (CD) learning algorithm. It also provides a complete and pre-processed dataset of handwritten letters of the English aplhabet. 

The application offers a GUI which enables the user to choose a dataset and determine parameters of the RBM and the CD algorithm. It also visualises the training performence on a dinamically ploted graph.
